                    Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the
                    nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the
                    Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent
                    Assembly, came into effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a
                    republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian
                    Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the
                    sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the independence movement
                    noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Indian National Congress
                    under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi who adopted these values from one of the early movements[1]
                    in India led by Ram Singh Kuka (quoted in one of the letters by Shaheed Bhagat Singh referring Guru
                    Ram Singh as his Dada Guru).Independence coincided with the partition of India,[2] in which British
                    India was divided into the Dominions of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent
                    riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious
                    violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian
                    national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi.

                    Independence Day, one of the three National holidays in India (the other two being the Republic Day
                    on 26 January and Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on 2 October), is observed in all Indian states and
                    union territories. On the eve of Independence Day, the President of India delivers the "Address to
                    the Nation". On 15 August, the Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag on the ramparts of the
                    historical site of Red Fort in Delhi.[3] In his speech, the Prime Minister highlights the past
                    year's achievements, raises important issues and calls for further development. He pays tribute to
                    the leaders of the Indian independence movement.<span class="d-block d-md-none d-lg-block"> The Indian national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana", is
                        sung. The speech is followed by a march past of divisions of the Indian Armed Forces and
                        paramilitary forces. Parades and pageants showcase scenes from the independence struggle and
                        India's
                        diverse cultural traditions. Similar events take place in state capitals where the Chief
                        Ministers
                        of individual states unfurl the national flag, followed by parades and pageants.[28][29] Until
                        1973,
                        the Governor of the State hoisted the National Flag at the State capital. In February 1974, the
                        Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi took up the issue with then Prime Minister Indira
                        Gandhi that the Chief Ministers, like the Prime Minister, should be allowed to hoist the
                        national
                        flag on Independence Day. Since 1974, Chief Ministers of the respective states have been allowed
                        to
                        hoist the national flag on Independence Day.
